# Selecting a network for crypto transfer

When depositing crypto or adding a withdrawal address, you may see several network options. These options determine the network your crypto will be sent through, which is essential to ensure that your funds are delivered safely.

Different networks have varying characteristics, including:

- fees  
- confirmation protocols  
- block sizes  
- transaction speeds  

Crypto tokens are only compatible with the blockchain(s) they are built for transacting on. Each chain uses its own cryptography, which means each chain speaks its own "language".

Before sending or receiving crypto, itâ€™s important to understand how to choose the correct network. Selecting the wrong network may result in your funds not reaching the intended address and may incur the loss of the funds.

## Withdrawing to another exchange/Web3 wallet

Itâ€™s very important to make sure the network of the receiving side is supported by CoinByte.

If you can't see the name of the network when you've copied the wallet address in, we most likely do not support withdrawals on that network. Some networks shown on the destination deposit page may not be supported by CoinByte.

**Verification:** You can typically verify which networks are supported by your destination wallet by checking its deposit page.

**The safest way to transfer crypto is to** send a small test transaction when you send to a new platform.

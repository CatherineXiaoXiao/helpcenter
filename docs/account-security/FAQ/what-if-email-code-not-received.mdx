We send email codes to the email address linked to your CoinByte account. Please note that:

<TickList>
  <li>Codes may take a few minutes to arrive.</li>
  <li>Each code is valid for 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Your account will be locked if you enter the incorrect code 6 times within a short time frame.</li>
</TickList>

**If you're not receiving the codes, try the following solutions:**

<TickList>
  <li>Clear your browser or app cache and then request a new code.</li>
  <li>Try requesting the code from different CoinByte platforms: desktop browser, mobile browser, or mobile app.</li>
  <li>Check if emails from CoinByte are in your spam folder. Sometimes, email providers mistakenly classify emails from CoinByte as spam. If this happens, please move the CoinByte emails out of the spam so that you can receive emails from CoinByte in the future.</li>
</TickList>

If the above solutions still do not resolve the issue, please contact our customer support team by emailing <a href="mailto:cs@coinbyte.com.au">cs@coinbyte.com.au</a> or via the online chatbot. Please use your email linked to the CoinByte account with login issue to contact us.

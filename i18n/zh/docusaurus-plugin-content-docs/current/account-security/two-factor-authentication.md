# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Learn how to set up and use two-factor authentication to enhance the security.

## What is Two-Factor Authentication?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an additional security layer that requires you to provide two different types of identification information when logging in:
- Something you know (your password)
- Something you have (your phone or authenticator app)

This significantly improves your account security, as even if someone obtains your password, they cannot log in without the second factor.

## Supported 2FA Methods

CoinByte supports the following 2FA options:

1. **Google Authenticator / Authy**: Generates 6-digit one-time verification codes
2. **SMS Verification**: Sends verification codes to your registered phone
3. **Email Verification**: Sends verification codes to your email
4. **Hardware Security Keys**: Physical security devices such as YubiKey

## Setting Up Google Authenticator

1. Go to "Account Settings > Security" and select "Set Up Two-Factor Authentication"
2. Choose the "Google Authenticator" option
3. Download the Google Authenticator app (iOS or Android)
4. Scan the displayed QR code with the app
5. Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by the app to confirm setup
6. Save the displayed backup recovery codes (to use if you lose your phone)

## Setting Up SMS Verification

1. Go to "Account Settings > Security" and select "Set Up Two-Factor Authentication"
2. Choose the "SMS Verification" option
3. Confirm your phone number
4. Enter the received verification code to complete setup

## Using 2FA to Log In

1. Enter your username and password
2. You will be prompted for second-factor verification
3. Depending on your chosen method, enter the verification code or use your hardware key
4. You will be logged in after successful verification

## Resetting 2FA

If you can't access your 2FA device:

1. Click "Can't access 2FA device?" on the login page
2. Choose to use recovery codes or contact support
3. If using recovery codes, enter the backup recovery code you saved during setup
4. After identity verification, you can set up 2FA again

## Security Tips

- Never share your 2FA verification codes with anyone
- Keep your backup recovery codes in a secure place
- Regularly check your login activity
- Consider using multiple 2FA methods for enhanced security
